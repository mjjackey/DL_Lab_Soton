You will have noticed that whilst defining the model was done in very few lines of code, that you actually had to do quite a lot of work to train and evaluate the model. Whilst the ability to have complete control over training and evaluation is useful (you'll see examples in later labs, and for the coursework you might come across situations where this is an absolute necessity), it can become rather tedious if you just want to perform a standard training and evaluation run. \n","\n","The [Torchbearer](https://github.com/ecs-vlc/torchbearer) library, written and maintained by members of the VLC research group in ECS, can help.
