A rectifier linear unit (ReLU) activation function is used for the neurons in the hidden layer.

In our model definition we've used a softmax activation function on the output layer to turn the outputs into probability-like values, but have only set this to be enabled when we are not training the model. We've done this because we will use PyTorch's implementation of Cross Entropy Loss (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`) during training which implicitly adds a softmax before a logarithmic loss (technically it adds a log-softmax activation followed by a negative log-likelihood loss as this has much better numerical properties).

In the code below we'll fit the model to the data over 10 epochs using batches of 128 images provided by the `DataLoader` defined previously. We'll make use of the ADAM optimiser as it broadly tends to work well practically despite its limitations.
