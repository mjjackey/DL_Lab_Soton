To explain what this means, suppose we take each of our parameter vectors $\\theta^{(j)}$, and subtract some fixed vector $\\psi$ from it, so that every $\\theta^{(j)}$ is now replaced with $\\theta^{(j)}−\\psi$ (for every $j=1,\\dots,k$). Our hypothesis now estimates the class label probabilities as\n","\n","\\begin{align}\n","P(y^{(i)} = k | x^{(i)} ; \\theta)\n","&= \\frac{\\exp((\\theta^{(k)}-\\psi)^\\top x^{(i)})}{\\sum_{j=1}^K \\exp( (\\theta^{(j)}-\\psi)^\\top x^{(i)})}  \\\\\n","&= \\frac{\\exp(\\theta^{(k)\\top} x^{(i)}) \\exp(-\\psi^\\top x^{(i)})}{\\sum_{j=1}^K \\exp(\\theta^{(j)\\top} x^{(i)}) \\exp(-\\psi^\\top x^{(i)})} \\\\\n","&= \\frac{\\exp(\\theta^{(k)\\top} x^{(i)})}{\\sum_{j=1}^K \\exp(\\theta^{(j)\\top} x^{(i)})}.\n","\\end{align}\n","\n","__In other words, subtracting $\\psi$ from every $\\theta^{(j)}$ does not affect our hypothesis’ predictions at all!__ This shows that softmax regression’s parameters are \"redundant\". More formally, we say that our softmax model is \"overparameterised\" meaning that for any hypothesis we might fit to the data, there are multiple parameter settings that give rise to exactly the same hypothesis function $h_\\theta$ mapping from inputs $\\mathbf{x}$ to the predictions.\n","\n","Further, if the cost function $J(\\theta)$ is minimized by some setting of the parameters $(\\theta^{(1)},\\theta^{(2)},\\dots,\\theta^{(k)})$, then it is also minimised by $\\theta^{(1)}-\\psi,\\theta^{(2)}-\\psi,\\dots,\\theta^{(k)}-\\psi)$ for any value of $\\psi$. Thus, the minimiser of $J(\\theta)$ is not unique. \n","\n","(Interestingly, $J(\\theta)$ is still convex, and thus gradient descent will not run into local optima problems. The Hessian is however singular/non-invertible, which causes a straightforward implementation of Newton's method (a second-order optimiser) to run into numerical problems.)\n","\n","Notice also that by setting $\\psi=\\theta^{(K)}$, one can always replace $\\theta^{(K)}$ with $\\theta^{(K)}-\\psi=\\mathbf{0}$ (the vector of all $0$’s), without affecting the hypothesis. Thus, one could \"eliminate\" the vector of parameters $\\theta^{(K)}$ (or any other $\\theta^{(k)}$, for any single value of $k$), without harming the representational power of our hypothesis. Indeed, rather than optimising over the $K \\cdot n$ parameters $(\\theta^{(1)},\\theta^{(2)},\\dots,\\theta^{(k)})$  (where $\\theta^{(k)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, one can instead set $\\theta^{(K)}=\\mathbf{0}$  and optimize only with respect to the $(K-1) \\cdot n$ remaining parameters."]},{"metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"checksum":"5a2fe88b85094401af28006c8d3c4e37","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-136a282d648894c1","locked":true,"schema_version":1,"solution":false},"id":"6UkfQ1fcq3S0","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["__Use the following block to implement the softmax gradients for the case where the final column of the parameters theta is fixed to be zero:__"]},{"metadata":{"deletable":false,"nbgrader":{"checksum":"752b313a062a6fc7934cd9a822b49c05","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-5f82a71197a01bdd","locked":false,"schema_version":1,"solution":true},"id":"2TWpvrYsq3S4","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["import torch\n","import torch.nn.functional as f\n","\n","'''\n","Theta: f*K(20*10)\n","X: num_items*f(100*20)\n","y: num_items*1(100*1) value:0~9\n","out: f*K\n","'''\n","def softmax_regression_loss_grad_0(Theta, X, y):\n","    '''Implementation of the gradient of the softmax loss function, with the parameters of the\n","    last class fixed to be zero.\n","    \n","    Theta is the matrix of parameters, with the parameters of the k-th class in the k-th column; \n","            K-1 classes are included, and the parameters of the last class are implicitly zero.\n","    X contains the data vectors (one vector per row)\n","    y is a column vector of the targets\n","    '''\n","    \n","    # add the missing column of zeros:\n","    Theta = torch.cat((Theta, torch.zeros(Theta.shape[0],1)), 1)\n","\n","    # YOUR CODE HERE\n","    num_classes = Theta.size()[1]  #(K+1)\n","    features_dim = Theta.size()[0]  #f\n","    num_items = y.size()[0]\n","    y_label = torch.zeros(num_items,num_classes,dtype=torch.float64).scatter_(1,y,1)  #num_items * (K+1)\n","    prob = f.softmax(X @ Theta, dim=1) #num_items*K, dim=1 for column\n","    grad = - X.t() @ (y_label - prob)  \n","  \n","    # remove the last column from the gradients\n","    grad = grad[0:grad.shape[0], 0:grad.shape[1]-1]\n","    return grad"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"checksum":"188e450a2df3dfafae8884f39dfbbed5","grade":true,"grade_id":"cell-64aef23ec9b37670","locked":true,"points":2,"schema_version":1,"solution":false},"id":"IdIO7Irbq3S-","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["Theta = torch.Tensor([[1, 0], [0, 0]])\n","X = torch.Tensor([[1, 0], [0, 1]])\n","y = torch.LongTensor([[0], [1]])\n","\n","grad = softmax_regression_loss_grad(Theta, X, y)\n","grad0 = softmax_regression_loss_grad_0(Theta[:,0:grad.shape[1]-1], X, y)\n","assert torch.torch.allclose(grad[:,0:grad.shape[1]-1], grad0)\n"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"checksum":"bcaff3402994537f507747a2f8d74f5e","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-58a854c27f8d089c","locked":true,"schema_version":1,"solution":false},"id":"lpxWpeAWq3TB","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Finally, we can run gradient descent with our reduced paramter gradient function, and confirm that the results are similar to before:"]},{"metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"checksum":"ca01d5452181b98755d19e124c7e8191","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-e8598e9ec2e830a6","locked":true,"schema_version":1,"solution":false},"id":"3FlArZoqq3TD","colab_type":"code","outputId":"87550a22-9adb-401a-812c-49c0e0b38f20","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1551452239984,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":10381,"user":{"displayName":"Jing Meng","photoUrl":"","userId":"00936490783355948018"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":53}},"cell_type":"code","source":["alpha = 0.1\n","theta_gd = torch.rand((X_train.shape[1], 9))\n","\n","for e in range(0, 1000):\n","    gr = softmax_regression_loss_grad_0(theta_gd, X_train, y_train)\n","    theta_gd -= alpha * gr\n","\n","theta_gd = torch.cat((theta_gd, torch.zeros(theta_gd.shape[0], 1)), 1)\n","proba = torch.softmax(X_test @ theta_gd, 1)\n","print(float((proba.argmax(1)-y_test[:,0]==0).sum()) / float(proba.shape[0]))\n","print()"],"execution_count":41,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["0.9108653220559532\n","\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"id":"jiZhTZ34Bk3-","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
